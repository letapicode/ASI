Thank you for improving the ASI prototype. To get started:

1. Use Python 3.10 or newer.
2. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Install the package in editable mode with `pip install -e .`.
4. Run tests with `pytest` before submitting a pull request.

You can run `scripts/setup_test_env.sh` to automate steps 2 and 3.
