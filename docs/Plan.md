## 1  Scaling-Efficiency Algorithms

| ID      | Algorithm-to-solve                                  | What it must do                                                                                | Success criterion                                                                                        |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **S-1** | **Sparse Mixture-of-Experts Routing (Switch-type)** | Activate ≤2 experts/token with *O*(1) router cost; keep cross-expert load-balance ≤3 % std-dev | 10 × parameter-count growth *without* >1.3 × training FLOPs ([medium.com][1])                            |
| **S-2** | **FlashAttention-3 kernel**                         | Exact soft-max attention in fused CUDA/ROCm kernel with block-wise recomputation               | ≥90 % GPU util. for 8 k→1 M tokens, Wall-time speed-up ≥2 × over FA-2 ([tridao.me][2])                   |
| **S-3** | **Scaling-law breakpoint model**                    | Predict test-loss vs (model, data, compute) past the current “diminishing-returns knee”        | Empirically fit to ≥3 new models above 3 T params; error <10 % ([businessinsider.com][3], [time.com][4]) |
| **S-4** | **4-bit Quantized LoRA Training**                   | Train LoRA-adapted models entirely in 4-bit weights                | ≤50 % memory of FP16 baseline at equal accuracy on 1 B+ params |

**Take-away:**  Parameter-scaling alone still improves raw capability, but returns are now *sub-linear*; the industry is already in the knee of the curve.  Architectural and data-efficiency gains (S-1, S-2) therefore matter more than brute size.

| **C-9** | **Hopfield Associative Memory** | Store binary patterns as attractors and recall them from noisy cues | Recall accuracy >95 % on 32-bit vectors with up to 20 % noise |

**Path to “trillion-token” context:** combine *C-1/2/3* for linear-or-sub-linear scaling, add **hierarchical retrieval** (store distant tokens in an external vector DB and re-inject on-demand).  Recurrence handles the whole stream; retrieval gives random access—context length becomes limited only by storage, not RAM.

## 6  Will “just scaling Transformers” reach ASI?

* Empirical scaling-law fits (S-3) and industry reports show *sharp diminishing returns* past the multi-trillion-parameter scale ([pnas.org][22], [time.com][4]).
* **Therefore:** Raw scaling is **necessary but not sufficient**.  Breakthroughs in *long-term memory (Section 2)*, *autonomous self-improvement (Section 3)*, and *robust alignment (Section 4)* are all required to bridge the gap to ASI.

---

### Practical roadmap to “infinite” context

1. **Linear-time backbone** (Mamba / RetNet).
2. **Streaming compression**: reservoir sampling + learned lossy compress to keep working set ≤O(log T).
3. **Hierarchical memory**: SSD-based vector store with learnable “link slots” (top-k retrieval).
4. **Chunk-wise retraining**: periodically fine-tune on *own* long-horizon transcripts to internalise far-past facts (solve catastrophic forgetting).

Combine 1-4 and the *effective* context limit becomes hardware bandwidth, not model design—conceptually “infinite”.

---

### Bottom line

* **Transformers will stay in the loop**, but solving *S-1 → S-3* + *C-1 → C-6* is what lifts the ceiling.
* **Quantum speed-ups (A-4)** slash search times yet do **not** remove the need for the safety stack (*L-1 → L-4*).
* When these algorithmic boxes are all ticked—and only then—scaling the system as a whole (not just the parameters) gives you a credible trajectory toward ASI.

### Current progress

- `src/moe_router.py` offers `HashRouter` and a `SwitchRouter` with learned gating and load-balance reporting.
- The router now accepts a `temperature` parameter and exposes `balance_loss_probs()` and
  `token_drop_rate()` metrics. With `temperature=0.7`, `scripts/benchmark_moe.py` reports
  load-balance std around **0.02**.
- `src/moe_layer.py` defines a simple MoE feed-forward layer using those routers.

- `src/scaling_law.py` implements a `BreakpointScalingLaw` model for the **S-3**
  scaling-law breakpoint task.
- `src/scaling_breakpoint.py` provides a light-weight `fit_breakpoint()` helper
  that returns a dataclass `BreakpointModel` with piecewise slopes.

  disk-backed `FaissVectorStore`.
- `src/hierarchical_memory.py` ties compression and retrieval together for
  hierarchical context. With a database path it hooks into FAISS so far-past
  tokens reload from disk automatically. Search results remain on the
  same device as the query.
- `src/link_slot_attention.py` implements retrieval-augmented attention that
  fetches top-k vectors from the hierarchical memory for each token.
- `src/megabyte_patching.py` adds a hierarchical byte patcher for **C-4**.
- `src/topk_sparse_attention.py` implements a top-k inference kernel for **C-5**.
- `src/paper_to_code.py` transpiles LaTeX pseudo-code to Python for **A-1**.
- `src/autobench.py` runs isolated test modules for **A-2** and
  `summarize_results()` prints a concise scoreboard with snippets from failing
  outputs.
- `src/meta_rl_refactor.py` implements a small Q-learning agent for **A-3**.
- `src/quantum_hpo.py` provides a quantum amplitude-estimation search for **A-4**. It now accepts architecture parameters to evaluate candidate transformer components.

- `src/iter_align.py` runs a simple iterative alignment loop for **L-3**.
- `src/critic_rlhf.py` provides a minimal critic-driven RLHF loop for **L-4**.
  See `docs/Implementation.md` and `docs/load_balance.md` for details.
- `src/pull_request_monitor.py` now supports asynchronous GitHub queries using
  `aiohttp` for faster monitoring of open pull requests.
- `src/lora_quant.py` provides 4-bit LoRA adapters and `apply_quant_lora()` to
  inject them into existing models.
- `src/cross_modal_fusion.py` encodes text, images and audio in a shared space
  with a contrastive training helper.
- `src/multimodal_world_model.py` unifies these embeddings with actions for
  world-model rollouts.
- `src/world_model_rl.py` contains a tiny model-based RL loop and evaluation
  helpers.
- `src/robot_skill_transfer.py` maps demonstration frames to control commands.
- `src/self_play_env.py` and `src/embodied_calibration.py` offer a sandbox for
  self-play and a sensor calibration routine.
- `src/formal_verifier.py` checks model snapshots against custom invariants.
- `src/eval_harness.py` aggregates metrics from all modules and prints a pass/fail scoreboard. The CLI now supports a `--concurrent` flag to run evaluations asynchronously via `evaluate_modules_async()`.
- `scripts/distributed_eval.py` runs the harness across multiple processes or hosts and aggregates the results for large-scale testing.
- `src/transformer_circuits.py` records attention weights and lets researchers ablate individual heads for interpretability experiments.

### Recommended next steps

- **Pinpoint a high-impact algorithm** from the tables above. Unsolved entries
  under Sections 1–3 yield the biggest leverage on capability.
- **Survey the latest papers** referenced in each section to understand the
  current state of the art and gaps that remain.
- **Formulate a clear research question** that ties the algorithm to a concrete
  success criterion from the table.
- **Prototype using the existing modules** in `src/` and keep the code modular
  so new components plug into the test suite.
- **Run `pytest`** after any code change to ensure baseline stability before
  measuring performance on benchmarks.
- **Document findings** in this file and in `docs/Implementation.md` so others
  can reproduce the experiments and build upon them.

    ≥4×.

41. **Summarizing memory compression**: Condense rarely accessed vectors with a small language model before persisting them to disk. Success is a ≥50 % reduction in storage while retrieval accuracy drops <5 %.
42. **Telemetry instrumentation**: Record GPU/CPU utilization and network throughput across distributed nodes using OpenTelemetry and expose the metrics via Prometheus. Overhead must remain <5 % on a 4-node cluster.
43. **License compliance checker**: Parse dataset sources for license text during ingestion and block incompatible samples. Every stored triple should include a valid license entry.
44. **Adaptive streaming compression**: Add `AdaptiveCompressor` to adjust the compression ratio in `StreamingCompressor` based on retrieval frequency.
45. **Prompt optimization**: Build a `PromptOptimizer` that learns prompt revisions via reinforcement learning and measure evaluation gains.
46. **Training anomaly detection**: Extend `SelfHealingTrainer` with a `TrainingAnomalyDetector` to roll back or restart runs when metrics diverge.
47. **Parameter-efficient adaptation**: Explore low-rank fine-tuning across tasks; success is matching baseline accuracy with ≤10% extra parameters.
48. **Context summarization memory**: Store compressed summaries for distant tokens and re-expand them on demand; success is >95% retrieval accuracy at 100× token length.
49. **Dataset lineage manager**: Automatically track dataset versions and transformations, enabling reproducible training pipelines.
50. **Multi-stage oversight**: Combine constitutional AI, deliberative alignment, and critic-in-the-loop RLHF with formal verification; success is <1% harmful output on the existing benchmarks.
51. **Self-supervised sensorimotor pretraining**: Pretrain the embodied world model on large unlabelled multimodal logs; success is 20% fewer real-world samples to reach 90% task success.
52. **Gradient compression for distributed training**: Implement a `GradientCompressor`
    with top-k sparsification or quantized gradients and integrate it with
    `DistributedTrainer`.
53. **ONNX export**: Provide `export_to_onnx()` and a script to save `MultiModalWorldModel` and `CrossModalFusion` as ONNX graphs.
54. **Memory profiling**: Instrument `HierarchicalMemory` with a lightweight profiler that records query counts, hit/miss ratios and latency.
55. **Secure federated learner**: Train models across remote peers using encrypted gradient aggregation. Accuracy should stay within 2% of centralized training.
56. **GPU-aware scheduler**: Monitor GPU memory and compute load to dispatch jobs dynamically. Throughput must scale nearly linearly across four GPUs.
57. **Adversarial robustness suite**: Generate gradient-based adversarial prompts and measure model degradation. Acceptable drop is <5% accuracy on the evaluation harness.
58. **Bias-aware dataset filtering**: Add `DatasetBiasDetector` to compute representation metrics and filter skewed samples. Goal is <5% disparity across demographic slices after filtering.
59. **Federated world-model training**: Train `world_model_rl` across multiple nodes via gradient averaging. Throughput should scale to four nodes with <1.2× single-node time.
60. **Parameter-efficient model editing**: Implement `GradientPatchEditor` to fix wrong outputs with minimal updates; >90% targeted fix rate with <1% perplexity change.
61. **Reasoning trace debugger**: Extend `GraphOfThought` with a debugger that flags contradictory steps, achieving >80% detection accuracy on synthetic traces.
62. **GraphQL memory gateway**: Expose `MemoryServer` queries through a GraphQL API and keep retrieval accuracy unchanged with <1.2× latency.
63. **Fine-grained telemetry profiler**: Record per-module compute and memory via `FineGrainedProfiler` and ensure overhead stays below 3%.
64. **Auto-labeling pipeline**: Use the world model to generate weak labels for unlabeled triples during ingestion and measure dataset quality improvements.
