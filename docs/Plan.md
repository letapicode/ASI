Below is a **shopping list of concrete algorithmic gaps** that must be closed on the road from
today’s LLMs to a self-improving Artificial Super-Intelligence (ASI).  Each entry names the
*exact algorithm (or family)*, why it matters, and what new result would count as “solved”.

## 1  Scaling-Efficiency Algorithms

| ID      | Algorithm-to-solve                                  | What it must do                                                                                | Success criterion                                                                                        |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **S-1** | **Sparse Mixture-of-Experts Routing (Switch-type)** | Activate ≤2 experts/token with *O*(1) router cost; keep cross-expert load-balance ≤3 % std-dev | 10 × parameter-count growth *without* >1.3 × training FLOPs ([medium.com][1])                            |
| **S-2** | **FlashAttention-3 kernel**                         | Exact soft-max attention in fused CUDA/ROCm kernel with block-wise recomputation               | ≥90 % GPU util. for 8 k→1 M tokens, Wall-time speed-up ≥2 × over FA-2 ([tridao.me][2])                   |
| **S-3** | **Scaling-law breakpoint model**                    | Predict test-loss vs (model, data, compute) past the current “diminishing-returns knee”        | Empirically fit to ≥3 new models above 3 T params; error <10 % ([businessinsider.com][3], [time.com][4]) |
| **S-4** | **4-bit Quantized LoRA Training**                   | Train LoRA-adapted models entirely in 4-bit weights                | ≤50 % memory of FP16 baseline at equal accuracy on 1 B+ params |

**Take-away:**  Parameter-scaling alone still improves raw capability, but returns are now *sub-linear*; the industry is already in the knee of the curve.  Architectural and data-efficiency gains (S-1, S-2) therefore matter more than brute size.

| ID      | Algorithm-to-solve                              | What it must do                                                    | Success criterion                                                                                                            |

| **C-6** | **RWKV infinite-context training loop**         | Constant-memory recurrence with token-shift trick                  | Train 7 B RWKV on 4 M-token samples, VRAM ≤80 GB; effective context ≥2 M at inference ([wiki.rwkv.com][12], [arxiv.org][13]) |
| **C-7** | **Hierarchical Retrieval Memory**         | Cache long-tail tokens in a disk-backed vector DB                     | Retrieval hit rate ≥85 % at 1 M tokens |
| **C-8** | **Distributed Hierarchical Memory Backend** | Share the vector store across nodes via a gRPC service (see `MemoryServer`, `RemoteMemory`) | Throughput scales to 4+ nodes with <1.2× single-node latency |

| **C-12** | **Differentiable Neural Computer memory** | Addressable memory matrix with learnable read/write heads | Store and recall 1 k vectors with <1 % error |

**Path to “trillion-token” context:** combine *C-1/2/3* for linear-or-sub-linear scaling, add **hierarchical retrieval** (store distant tokens in an external vector DB and re-inject on-demand).  Recurrence handles the whole stream; retrieval gives random access—context length becomes limited only by storage, not RAM.  Privacy-preserving retrieval is now possible via `EncryptedVectorStore`, which stores AES-encrypted embeddings and manages keys through `HierarchicalMemory`. FHEMemoryServer goes a step further, allowing remote encrypted queries via TenSEAL.
Experiments with a `DNCMemory` backend add learnable read/write heads on top of the vector store. The module now exposes device and dtype options and supports memory resets.

See `docs/Implementation.md` for the optimisation workflow.

`SemanticDriftDetector` monitors predictions between checkpoints by computing KL divergence of output distributions. Call it from `WorldModelDebugger.check()` to flag unexpected behaviour changes before patching.
- **Automated documentation**: run `python -m asi.doc_summarizer <module>` to keep module summaries under `docs/autodoc/` up to date.
- **Code refinement pipeline**: run `scripts/code_refine.py <file>` to clean up LLM-generated Python before committing. The tool adds `Any` type hints, fixes `None`/`bool` comparisons and ensures future annotations.

- **Reasoning graph merger**: `reasoning_merger.merge_graphs()` deduplicates nodes across agents and aligns timestamps. The `MultiAgentDashboard` now displays the merged trace.

- **Zero-knowledge gradients**: set `require_proof=True` in `SecureFederatedLearner` to verify updates with `ZKVerifier` before aggregation.

## 5  Multimodal & Embodied Algorithms

| ID      | Algorithm-to-solve                      | What it must do                                                                     | Success criterion                                                                |
| ------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **M-1** | **Cross-Modal Fusion Architecture**     | Learn a single latent space for text, images and audio                              | ≥85 % F1 on zero-shot image↔text retrieval; audio caption BLEU within 5 % of SOTA |
| **M-2** | **World-Model RL Bridge**               | Train a generative world model from logs and run model-based RL for fast policy updates | Real robot tasks reach 90 % of offline policy reward after <10k physical steps   |
| **M-3** | **Self-Calibration for Embodied Agents**| Adapt sensors and actuators from small real-world samples                           | Simulation-trained policies retain ≥80 % success with <1k labelled real samples   |
|         | *Sim2Real Adapter workflow* | Learn a linear mapping from real logs and pass ``calibration_traces`` into ``train_world_model`` to align the simulator. |
| **M-4** | **Cross-Modal Data Ingestion Pipeline** | Pair text, images and audio from open datasets with augmentations | Prepare 1 M aligned triples in under 1 h with retrieval F1 near baseline |

The helper `download_triples()` now uses `aiohttp` to fetch files concurrently, speeding up dataset preparation.

`CarbonAwareDatasetIngest` wraps this helper with `CarbonAwareScheduler`. Set `threshold` and `region` to postpone downloads until carbon intensity drops below the limit. Internal runs with `threshold=300` gCO₂/kWh saved ~30 % of the energy versus immediate fetching.

Example usage:

```python
from asi.sim2real_adapter import Sim2RealAdapter, Sim2RealConfig
from asi.world_model_rl import train_world_model

adapter = Sim2RealAdapter(Sim2RealConfig(state_dim=3))
adapter.fit(real_logs)  # list of (sim_state, real_state)
wm = train_world_model(cfg, dataset, calibration_traces=real_logs)
```

## 6  Will “just scaling Transformers” reach ASI?

* Empirical scaling-law fits (S-3) and industry reports show *sharp diminishing returns* past the multi-trillion-parameter scale ([pnas.org][22], [time.com][4]).
* **Therefore:** Raw scaling is **necessary but not sufficient**.  Breakthroughs in *long-term memory (Section 2)*, *autonomous self-improvement (Section 3)*, and *robust alignment (Section 4)* are all required to bridge the gap to ASI.

---

### Practical roadmap to “infinite” context

1. **Linear-time backbone** (Mamba / RetNet).
2. **Streaming compression**: reservoir sampling + learned lossy compress to keep working set ≤O(log T).
3. **Hierarchical memory**: SSD-based vector store with learnable “link slots” (top-k retrieval).
4. **Chunk-wise retraining**: periodically fine-tune on *own* long-horizon transcripts to internalise far-past facts (solve catastrophic forgetting).

Combine 1-4 and the *effective* context limit becomes hardware bandwidth, not model design—conceptually “infinite”.

---

### Bottom line

* **Transformers will stay in the loop**, but solving *S-1 → S-3* + *C-1 → C-6* is what lifts the ceiling.
* **Quantum speed-ups (A-4)** slash search times yet do **not** remove the need for the safety stack (*L-1 → L-4*).
* When these algorithmic boxes are all ticked—and only then—scaling the system as a whole (not just the parameters) gives you a credible trajectory toward ASI.

### Current progress

- Prototype modules for **S-1** and **S-2** have been added in `src/`.
- `src/moe_router.py` offers `HashRouter` and a `SwitchRouter` with learned gating and load-balance reporting.
- The router now accepts a `temperature` parameter and exposes `balance_loss_probs()` and
  `token_drop_rate()` metrics. With `temperature=0.7`, `scripts/benchmark_moe.py` reports
  load-balance std around **0.02**.
- `src/moe_layer.py` defines a simple MoE feed-forward layer using those routers.
- `src/flash_attention3.py` wraps the FlashAttention‑3 kernel and exposes `_HAS_FLASH3`.
- `scripts/benchmark_moe.py` and `scripts/moe_vs_dense.py` estimate FLOPs with and without routing; both now accept `--router switch`.
- `src/scaling_law.py` implements a `BreakpointScalingLaw` model for the **S-3**
  scaling-law breakpoint task.
- `src/scaling_breakpoint.py` provides a light-weight `fit_breakpoint()` helper
  that returns a dataclass `BreakpointModel` with piecewise slopes.
- `src/retnet_retention.py` implements a RetNet-style retention kernel for **C-1**.
- `src/mamba_block.py` provides a simplified Mamba state-space block for **C-2**.
- `src/hyena_filter.py` implements the implicit-FFT filter for **C-3**.
- `src/streaming_compression.py` maintains a reservoir buffer with a small
  autoencoder for **streaming compression**.
- `src/vector_store.py` stores embeddings in memory and now supports a
  disk-backed `FaissVectorStore`.
- `src/hierarchical_memory.py` ties compression and retrieval together for
  hierarchical context. With a database path it hooks into FAISS so far-past
  tokens reload from disk automatically. Search results remain on the
  same device as the query.
- `VectorStore.hyde_search()` blends a hypothetical document embedding with the
  query before nearest-neighbour lookup. Use `HierarchicalMemory.search(mode="hyde")`
  or its async counterpart to enable this HyDE-style retrieval.
- `src/async_vector_store.py` exposes `ahyde_search()` for background HyDE retrieval
  when using FAISS asynchronously.
- `src/link_slot_attention.py` implements retrieval-augmented attention that
  fetches top-k vectors from the hierarchical memory for each token.
- `src/megabyte_patching.py` adds a hierarchical byte patcher for **C-4**.
- `src/topk_sparse_attention.py` implements a top-k inference kernel for **C-5**.
- `src/paper_to_code.py` transpiles LaTeX pseudo-code to Python for **A-1**.
- `src/autobench.py` runs isolated test modules for **A-2** and
  `summarize_results()` prints a concise scoreboard with snippets from failing
  outputs.
- `src/meta_rl_refactor.py` implements a small Q-learning agent for **A-3**.
- `src/quantum_hpo.py` provides a quantum amplitude-estimation search for **A-4**. It now accepts architecture parameters to evaluate candidate transformer components.
- `src/meta_optimizer.py` wraps training loops in a simple MAML cycle and integrates with `AdaptivePlanner` for continuous tuning.
- `src/rwkv_loop.py` demonstrates the infinite-context loop for **C-6**.
- `src/chunkwise_retrainer.py` implements chunk-wise retraining on long transcripts.
- `src/collective_constitution.py` aggregates crowd-sourced rules for **L-1**.
- `src/deliberative_alignment.py` checks chain-of-thought steps for **L-2**.
- `src/normative_reasoner.py` enforces configurable ethics rules for **L-2**. It
  supports regular-expression rules and optional fuzzy matching to catch
  near-miss violations.
- `src/iter_align.py` runs a simple iterative alignment loop for **L-3**.
- `src/critic_rlhf.py` provides a minimal critic-driven RLHF loop for **L-4**.
  See `docs/Implementation.md` and `docs/load_balance.md` for details.
- `src/bci_feedback_trainer.py` converts EEG signals into rewards and flags
  discomfort or disagreement patterns. These events pass through
  `deliberative_alignment.check_alignment()` to flip rewards when the policy
  deems them misaligned. `AlignmentDashboard` now reports the count of such
  BCI-derived events.
- `src/rlaif_trainer.py` runs a synthetic-critic RLAIF loop for **L-7**.
- `src/pull_request_monitor.py` now supports asynchronous GitHub queries using
  `aiohttp` for faster monitoring of open pull requests.
- `src/lora_quant.py` provides 4-bit LoRA adapters and `apply_quant_lora()` to
  inject them into existing models.
- `src/spiking_layers.py` defines `LIFNeuron` and `SpikingLinear`. Set
  `use_spiking=True` in `MultiModalWorldModelConfig` to replace MLP blocks with
  these energy-efficient neurons. When the optional Loihi SDK is installed,
  enable `use_loihi=True` to run them on neuromorphic hardware via
  `src/loihi_backend.py`.
- `src/edge_rl_trainer.py` now takes a `use_loihi` flag and logs power
  consumption for CPU vs. Loihi execution through `TelemetryLogger`.
- `src/fpga_backend.py` adds an `FPGAAccelerator` and optional `use_fpga`
  flag in `MultiModalWorldModelConfig` and `EdgeRLTrainer` for FPGA offload.
- - `src/analog_backend.py` adds an `AnalogAccelerator` context manager for
   analog matrix multiplies. Enable `use_analog=True` in
   `MultiModalWorldModelConfig` or `EdgeRLTrainer` to patch `torch.matmul`
   during training.
- `src/cross_modal_fusion.py` encodes text, images and audio in a shared space
  with a contrastive training helper.
- `src/multimodal_world_model.py` unifies these embeddings with actions for
  world-model rollouts.
- `src/world_model_rl.py` contains a tiny model-based RL loop and evaluation
  helpers.
- `src/robot_skill_transfer.py` maps demonstration frames to control commands.
- `src/self_play_env.py` and `src/embodied_calibration.py` offer a sandbox for
  self-play and a sensor calibration routine.
- `src/formal_verifier.py` checks model snapshots against custom invariants.
- `src/eval_harness.py` aggregates metrics from all modules and prints a pass/fail scoreboard. The CLI now supports a `--concurrent` flag to run evaluations asynchronously via `evaluate_modules_async()`.
- `scripts/distributed_eval.py` runs the harness across multiple processes or hosts and aggregates the results for large-scale testing.
- `src/transformer_circuits.py` records attention weights and lets researchers ablate individual heads for interpretability experiments.
- `src/transformer_circuit_analyzer.py` computes head importance via gradients or ablation. `GraphOfThought` can log these scores and the `InterpretabilityDashboard` displays them per step.
- `src/ab_evaluator.py` compares two `eval_harness` runs given JSON configs so new features can be iteratively benchmarked.

### Recommended next steps

- **Pinpoint a high-impact algorithm** from the tables above. Unsolved entries
  under Sections 1–3 yield the biggest leverage on capability.
- **Survey the latest papers** referenced in each section to understand the
  current state of the art and gaps that remain.
- **Formulate a clear research question** that ties the algorithm to a concrete
  success criterion from the table.
- **Prototype using the existing modules** in `src/` and keep the code modular
  so new components plug into the test suite.
- **Run `pytest`** after any code change to ensure baseline stability before
  measuring performance on benchmarks.
- **Document findings** in this file and in `docs/Implementation.md` so others
  can reproduce the experiments and build upon them.

### Short-Term Research Tasks

1. **Hybrid retention backbone**: Fuse `RetNetRetention` with `MambaBlock` and
   measure throughput and memory compared with the individual kernels.
   *Implemented in `src/hybrid_retention.py` with unit tests.*
2. **Cross-modal retrieval memory**: Store embeddings from
   `cross_modal_fusion.encode_all()` inside `HierarchicalMemory` and evaluate
 retrieval accuracy on 1&nbsp;M-token streams. *Implemented via
  `add_multimodal()` in `cross_modal_fusion.py` and related unit tests.*
3. **Sign-language ingestion**: `download_triples()` accepts sign-video URLs and
   `encode_all()` stores the recognized embeddings for retrieval. The
   `SignLanguageRecognizer` now classifies a couple of common gestures so signs
   like *hello* and *thanks* can be queried across languages.
3a. **Event sensor fusion**: `EventSensorDataset` ingests arrays or ``.npy`` files
    containing DVS or neuromorphic microphone events. `train_world_model()` can
    fuse them when `use_event_streams=True`. The average loss is reported via
    `TelemetryLogger.world_model_loss` for monitoring.
4. **LoRA-quantized world model**: *Implemented* via a `use_lora` option in
   `multimodal_world_model.py` which wraps the transformer layers with
   quantized adapters.
5. **QAE-guided refactoring**: Employ `QAEHyperparamSearch` to tune exploration
   parameters in `MetaRLRefactorAgent` and track benchmark uplift.
6. **Scalability metrics**: *(done)* `eval_harness.py` now records GPU memory
   usage via `log_memory_usage()` and prints it alongside pass/fail results.
7. **Compute budget tracking**: Use `ComputeBudgetTracker` to log GPU hours and
   energy cost for each run and stop training when the budget is exhausted.
8. **Budget-aware scheduler**: Automatically lower batch size and learning rate
   via `BudgetAwareScheduler` when `remaining()` falls below a threshold.
7a. **Battery-aware scheduler**: Delay jobs when system battery level falls
    below a configurable threshold. `BatteryAwareScheduler` queries the OS for
    the current percentage and logs it via `TelemetryLogger` so runs on laptops
    can conserve power.
9. **Distributed memory benchmark**: Run `DistributedMemory` with four
   `MemoryServer` nodes using `distributed_memory_benchmark.py` and measure
   query latency and throughput versus the single-node baseline.
10. **MemoryServer streaming API**: Benchmark the new batched push/query
   endpoints and report latency savings over single-vector calls.
11. **Checkpointed world model**: *(done)* the multimodal world model now
   supports a `checkpoint_blocks` flag which reduces memory usage during
   training.
12. **Self-play dataset fusion**: *(implemented)* `train_with_self_play` records
   trajectories from `self_play_skill_loop.run_loop` and feeds them into
   `train_world_model` for mixed-modality experiments.
13. **Opponent strategy evolution**: `opponent_generator.OpponentGenerator`
    maintains a pool of past policies and samples them by reward.
    Success criterion: ≥10 % performance gain on held-out tasks after
    five self-play cycles.
14. **Attention trace analysis**: Use the new `AttentionVisualizer` to
   inspect long-context retrieval patterns on ≥1&nbsp;M-token evaluations.
    `RetrievalExplainer` extends `HierarchicalMemory.search()` with similarity scores and provenance so these traces are visible through the memory dashboard. `summarize_multimodal()` now formats text snippets and media paths for richer summaries.
15. **Graph-of-thought planning**: Implement `GraphOfThought` (see
    `src/graph_of_thought.py`) and measure refactor quality gains over the
    baseline meta-RL agent. The `ReasoningDebugger` now aggregates loops and
    contradictions across multiple agents.
12. **Neuro-symbolic world model**: Integrate `NeuroSymbolicExecutor` with
    `world_model_rl.rollout_policy()` and log constraint violations.
    *Implemented as `src/neuro_symbolic_executor.py`.*
13. **Self-healing distributed trainer**: Wrap `world_model_rl.train_world_model()`
    in a `DistributedTrainer` that automatically resumes from failures.
    *Implemented in `src/distributed_trainer.py` with integration tests.*
14. **Edge-memory virtualization**: Stream context from `HierarchicalMemory`
    through `RemoteMemory` so low-memory devices can handle large-context
    inference. *Implemented in `src/edge_memory_client.py` with tests.*
15. **Adaptive curriculum scheduler**: Mix curated datasets with self-play logs
    via reinforcement learning to accelerate skill acquisition. Implemented in
    `adaptive_curriculum.py` and used by `self_play_skill_loop`.
15a. **Cognitive load monitor**: `cognitive_load_monitor.CognitiveLoadMonitor`
    tracks pause durations and correction rates. Callbacks receive each load
    update so UI components can react in real time. `AdaptiveCurriculum`
    adjusts retrieval depth or task difficulty based on the metric and exposes
    values through `TelemetryLogger`.
16. **Quantum architecture search**: Extend `QAEHyperparamSearch` to explore
    novel transformer components and report promising variants.
    *Implemented in `src/quantum_hpo.py` with unit tests.*
17. **Elastic mixture-of-experts routing**: *Implemented in `src/elastic_moe_router.py`.*
    The router varies active expert counts based on GPU load and compares load
    balance with the static `SwitchRouter`.
18. **SSD-backed retrieval cache**: Extend `HierarchicalMemory` with an
    `SSDCache` that prefetches frequently accessed vectors for low-latency
    retrieval. *Implemented in `src/hierarchical_memory.py`.*
19. **Adaptive eviction policy**: `HierarchicalMemory` now tracks hit/miss rates
    and adjusts `evict_limit` automatically. Use `adaptive_evict=True` to enable
    and inspect stats via `get_stats()`.
20. **Generative noise filtering**: `AutoDatasetFilter` now runs during data
    ingest to prune low-quality samples using generative noise detection and
    track the effect on training stability.
21. **Generative data augmentor**: Use `GenerativeDataAugmentor` to synthesize
    new training triples from world-model rollouts and expand the dataset. When
    paired with `DiffusionWorldModel`, the augmentor samples diverse environment
    states to improve world-model coverage. The module integrates with
    `data_ingest` for easy ingestion.
22. **Continuous evaluation**: Run `continuous_eval.py` after each pull request
    to track benchmark progress automatically. *Implemented in
    `scripts/continuous_eval.py`.*
23. **Continuous adversarial evaluation**: Schedule adversarial tests via
    `AdversarialRobustnessScheduler` and log metrics in
    `scripts/continuous_eval.py`.
24. **Adaptive planning agent**: Merge `GraphOfThoughtPlanner` with
    `MetaRLRefactorAgent` to auto-rank refactor strategies. *Implemented in
    `src/adaptive_planner.py`.*
25. **Neural architecture search**: Evaluate `src/neural_arch_search.py` across
    candidate module configurations and report accuracy vs. compute costs.
    The search now logs energy usage via `TelemetryLogger` and supports an
    `energy_weight` option to trade off accuracy against consumption.
    *Implemented in `src/neural_arch_search.py`.*
25a. **Neuroevolution search**: `src/neuroevolution_search.py` mutates and
    crosses over configs in a population. The interface plugs into
    `neural_arch_search.DistributedArchSearch` via ``method="evolution"`` so
    the evaluation harness can switch strategies. Each generation benchmarks
    candidates via `eval_harness`. The CLI script
    `scripts/neuroevolution_search.py` runs experiments.
25. **Self-healing distributed training**: Deploy `SelfHealingTrainer` to
    restart failed jobs automatically and track overall utilization.
    *Implemented in `src/self_healing_trainer.py`.*
26. **World-model data synthesis**: Use the `offline_synthesizer` to generate
    synthetic multimodal triples and measure retrieval improvements. *Implemented
    in `data_ingest.offline_synthesizer`.*
27. **Federated memory exchange**: Synchronize retrieval vectors across
    multiple `MemoryServer` nodes and benchmark cross-node accuracy.
    *Implemented in `src/federated_memory_exchange.py` with
    `scripts/federated_memory_sync.py`.*
28. **Causal graph learner**: Train `CausalGraphLearner` on `world_model_rl`
    transitions and report planning gains from the inferred edges.
    *Implemented in `src/causal_graph_learner.py`.*
29. **Counterfactual simulation**: Use `world_model_rl.simulate_counterfactual()`
    with edges from `CausalGraphLearner` to evaluate hypothetical actions and
    refine plans. *Implemented in `src/world_model_rl.py` with
    `scripts/causal_sim.py`.*
29. **Structured knowledge graph memory**: Store facts as triples in a `KnowledgeGraphMemory` and retrieve them through `HierarchicalMemory` for better planning context.
    The new `GraphNeuralReasoner` loads these triples and predicts missing relations so `HierarchicalPlanner.query_relation()` can infer edges not explicitly stored.
    `KnowledgeGraphMemory` now records optional timestamps per triple and supports temporal range queries for time-sensitive reasoning.
29b. **Timestamped reasoning graph**: `GraphOfThought` nodes and edges may include timestamps. `TemporalReasoner.order_nodes_by_time(compress=True)` reorders or collapses past steps so `HierarchicalPlanner.compose_plan()` follows their chronological order.
29a. **Cross-lingual knowledge graph memory**: `CrossLingualKGMemory` wraps
    `KnowledgeGraphMemory` with a `CrossLingualTranslator`. `add_triples_multilingual()`
    stores translated triples and `query_translated()` returns results in the
    requested language.
29. **Temporal reasoner**: `TemporalReasoner` queries these timestamped triples
    to infer before/after relationships. `HierarchicalPlanner.compose_plan()`
    can optionally reorder intermediate steps using the reasoner for time-aware
    planning. The reasoner now caches triple timestamps for faster
    reordering.
29. **Self-alignment evaluator**: Integrate
    `deliberative_alignment.check_alignment()` into `eval_harness` and track
    alignment metrics alongside existing benchmarks. *Implemented in
    `src/eval_harness.py` as `SelfAlignmentEvaluator`.*

30. **Federated memory backend**: Implement a `FederatedMemoryServer` that
    replicates vector stores across peers via gRPC streaming consensus for
    decentralized retrieval. The service now exposes a `Sync` RPC and uses
    CRDT update rules so that multiple servers converge on identical vector
    stores after exchanging updates.
31. **Active data selection**: `ActiveDataSelector` now outputs continuous
    sample weights based on predictive entropy and down-weights biased
    examples using `dataset_bias_detector`. A new `SampleWeightRL` loop
    updates the weights online during training. *Implemented in
    `data_ingest.ActiveDataSelector` and `adaptive_curriculum.SampleWeightRL`.*
32. **Hierarchical graph planner**: Combine `GraphOfThought` with
    `world_model_rl.rollout_policy` to generate multi-stage plans for
    refactoring and exploration.
33. **Differential privacy optimizer**: Integrate gradient clipping and noise
    injection into training loops so models can train with privacy guarantees.
34. **LSH retrieval index**: Add `LocalitySensitiveHashIndex` in `vector_store.py` so
    `HierarchicalMemory` can perform approximate nearest neighbor search with
    sub-linear query time.
35. **Embedding visualizer**: Build a module to project cross-modal embeddings using UMAP/t-SNE and expose the plots via a lightweight web viewer. Implemented in `src/embedding_visualizer.py`.
36. **Multi-agent coordinator**: Prototype a `MultiAgentCoordinator` that
    synchronizes multiple refactor agents and schedules collaborative
    improvements across repositories.
37. **Compressed vector store**: Implement a `PQVectorStore` using FAISS `IndexIVFPQ`
    and integrate with `HierarchicalMemory`. Benchmark retrieval accuracy vs.
    `FaissVectorStore`.
37a. **Quantum retrieval benchmark**: `quantum_retrieval.amplify_search()`
     applies amplitude amplification to select vectors. On a toy index its
     accuracy matches FAISS within ~20% latency overhead. The routine now
     accepts language tags from `CrossLingualMemory`; running
     `scripts/quantum_crosslingual_benchmark.py` shows parity across languages
     with ~1.5× latency.
37b. **Quantum memory server**: `quantum_memory_server` exposes gRPC APIs
     for vector search using `quantum_retrieval.amplify_search`. The accompanying
     `QuantumMemoryClient` lets peers push embeddings and query the server over
     the network.
37c. **Ephemeral vector store**: `EphemeralVectorStore` keeps in-memory vectors
     with a TTL and integrates into `HierarchicalMemory` via `store_type="ephemeral"`.
38. **Duplicate data filter**: Use CLIP embeddings with locality-sensitive
    hashing to drop near-duplicate samples during ingestion and connect it to
    `AutoDatasetFilter`.
39. **Temporal decay memory**: Add a `TemporalVectorCompressor` that weights
    embeddings by recency. Evaluate retrieval accuracy drop <3% compared with
    the existing `StreamingCompressor` on 1&nbsp;M-token streams.
40. **Cross-lingual data ingestion**: Integrate a `CrossLingualTranslator`
    into `data_ingest` so text is stored in multiple languages. *Implemented*
    via the optional ``translator`` argument of ``download_triples()`` which
    saves translated files alongside the originals. Translated triples are now
    passed through `cross_modal_fusion.encode_all()` and their fused embeddings
    are stored in `HierarchicalMemory` with language tags for language-agnostic
    retrieval.
    so queries in any supported language return the same results. The optional
    `CrossLingualSpeechTranslator` transcribes audio queries offline and feeds
    the text through `CrossLingualTranslator` for unified search.
40b. **Multilingual paraphrasing augmentation**: `paraphrase_multilingual()`
    expands each text file with paraphrases in the translator's languages. The
    helper uses `AutoDatasetFilter` and `LicenseInspector` to keep only clean and
    compliant outputs while logging stats via `DatasetLineageManager`. Measure
    fairness gains by running `CrossLingualFairnessEvaluator` on the dataset
    before and after augmentation—expect the demographic parity gap to shrink
    by at least 5%.
40c. **Image and audio fairness metrics**: `FairnessEvaluator.evaluate_multimodal()`
    computes demographic parity and equal opportunity for image and audio
    datasets. `ingest_translated_triples()` now records per-modality statistics
    so these metrics reflect dataset composition.
40d. **LLM-based ingestion parser**: `LLMIngestParser` extracts structured
     triples from raw text using a lightweight spaCy model with a
     heuristic fallback. The parser caches the loaded model and honors the
     ``LLM_PARSER_MODEL`` environment variable to customize loading. Calling
     `download_triples(use_llm_parser=True)` saves triples to
     ``*.triples.json`` files for downstream RAG pipelines ([arxiv.org][15]).
41a. **Cross-lingual summarization memory**: `ContextSummaryMemory` stores summaries
     in the source language and translated forms. Results are translated back
     to the query language. See `docs/Implementation.md` for details.
41b. **Cross-lingual reasoning graph**: `CrossLingualReasoningGraph` stores reasoning
    steps with language tags. `GraphOfThoughtPlanner` can record ranked plans so
    they are retrievable in multiple languages. Old steps are summarised into
    `ContextSummaryMemory` with translations so `query_summary()` can return the
    compressed trace in any language. Evaluate by confirming the same plan is
    found in at least two languages.
41b1. **Multilingual Graph UI**: The HTML interface offers a language selector so
      nodes are displayed and edited in the chosen language using
      `CrossLingualReasoningGraph.translate_node()`.
41c. **Multimodal reasoning graph**: `CrossLingualReasoningGraph.add_step()`
     accepts `image_embed` and `audio_embed`. Use `embed_modalities()` from
     `CrossModalFusion` to generate vectors. `ReasoningHistoryLogger` preserves
     `image_vec` and `audio_vec` when saving histories.
41d. **Reasoning-graph knowledge bridge**: `reasoning_kb_bridge.graph_to_triples()`
     converts graph nodes and edges into `(subject, predicate, object)` triples
     for `KnowledgeGraphMemory`. `HistoryKGExporter` periodically pushes
     `ReasoningHistoryLogger` summaries into the knowledge graph with
     timestamps so planners can query past reasoning steps via
     `get_following_steps()`.
42. **World-model distillation**: Implement a `WorldModelDistiller` that
    compresses the large world model into a smaller student network. Target
    <5% reward loss on the embodied RL benchmarks while reducing model size by
    ≥4×.

43. **Summarizing memory compression**: Condense rarely accessed vectors with a small language model before persisting them to disk. Success is a ≥50 % reduction in storage while retrieval accuracy drops <5 %.
44. **Telemetry instrumentation**: Record GPU/CPU utilization and network throughput across distributed nodes using OpenTelemetry and expose the metrics via Prometheus. Overhead must remain <5 % on a 4-node cluster. *`MemoryServer` now accepts a `TelemetryLogger` to start and stop metrics automatically.*
45. **Memory usage dashboard**: Aggregate telemetry from multiple memory nodes and present hit/miss rates in real time.
46. **License compliance checker**: Parse dataset sources for license text during ingestion and block incompatible samples. Every stored triple should include a valid license entry.
47. **Adaptive streaming compression**: Add `AdaptiveCompressor` to adjust the compression ratio in `StreamingCompressor` based on retrieval frequency.
48. **Prompt optimization**: Build a `PromptOptimizer` that learns prompt revisions via reinforcement learning and measure evaluation gains.
49. **Training anomaly detection**: Extend `SelfHealingTrainer` with a `TrainingAnomalyDetector` to roll back or restart runs when metrics diverge.
49a. **Distributed anomaly monitoring**: `DistributedAnomalyMonitor` collects per-node anomaly metrics and flags cross-run spikes through `RiskDashboard`.
50. **Parameter-efficient adaptation**: Explore low-rank fine-tuning across tasks; success is matching baseline accuracy with ≤10% extra parameters.
51. **Context summarization memory**: Store compressed summaries for distant tokens and re-expand them on demand; success is >95% retrieval accuracy at 100× token length. *Implemented in `src/context_summary_memory.py` with tests.*
51a. **Multi-modal summarization memory**: Compress image and audio features into short summaries stored with text embeddings; retrieval using fused summaries must reach ≥90% accuracy. *Implemented in `src/multimodal_summary_memory.py` with tests.*
52. **Dataset lineage manager**: Automatically track dataset versions and transformations, enabling reproducible training pipelines. *Implemented in `src/dataset_lineage_manager.py`.*
    Use `DataProvenanceLedger` to append a signed hash of each lineage record. Run `scripts/check_provenance.py <root>` to verify the ledger.
52a. **Zero-trust memory server**: `ZeroTrustMemoryServer` validates signed access tokens against a `BlockchainProvenanceLedger` before serving requests. Unauthorized clients are rejected.
52b. **Dataset watermarking**: `dataset_watermarker.py` embeds and detects watermarks in text, images and audio. Lineage records now include watermark IDs.
53. **Multi-stage oversight**: Combine constitutional AI, deliberative alignment, and critic-in-the-loop RLHF with formal verification; success is <1% harmful output on the existing benchmarks.
54. **Self-supervised sensorimotor pretraining**: Pretrain the embodied world model on large unlabelled multimodal logs; success is 20% fewer real-world samples to reach 90% task success.
55. **Gradient compression for distributed training**: Implement a `GradientCompressor`
    with top-k sparsification or quantized gradients and integrate it with
    `DistributedTrainer`.
55a. **Asynchronous parameter averaging**: Enable `DistributedTrainer.async_mode`
     so multiple workers apply gradients locally and periodically merge via
     parameter averaging.
56. **ONNX export**: Provide `export_to_onnx()` and a script to save `MultiModalWorldModel` and `CrossModalFusion` as ONNX graphs.
56a. **WASM export**: Add `export_to_wasm()` to turn the ONNX graphs into WebAssembly bundles for `onnxruntime-web`.
57. **Memory profiling**: Instrument `HierarchicalMemory` with a lightweight profiler that records query counts, hit/miss ratios and latency.
58. **Secure federated learner**: Train models across remote peers using encrypted gradient aggregation. Accuracy should stay within 2% of centralized training.
59. **GPU-aware scheduler**: Monitor GPU memory and compute load to dispatch jobs dynamically. Combined with `ComputeBudgetTracker`, the new `AdaptiveScheduler` automatically pauses or resumes runs based on remaining GPU hours and historical improvement. *Carbon-intensity data now guide the scheduler to prefer lower-emission nodes, reducing the environmental footprint.*
59a. **Heterogeneous accelerator scheduling**: `hardware_detect.list_*` enumerates CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, Loihi and analog devices. `AdaptiveScheduler` now queues jobs per device type and picks the region/device with the lowest energy cost and carbon intensity via `TelemetryLogger`.
60. **Adversarial robustness suite**: Generate gradient-based adversarial prompts and measure model degradation. Acceptable drop is <5% accuracy on the evaluation harness.
61. **Bias-aware dataset filtering**: Add `DatasetBiasDetector` to compute representation metrics and filter skewed samples. Goal is <5% disparity across demographic slices after filtering.
61a. **Dataset bias mitigation**: `DataBiasMitigator` reweights or filters entries based on these scores. `download_triples()` now applies the mitigator before storing new files.
<<<<<<< HEAD
61b. **Fairness gap visualizer**: `fairness_visualizer.FairnessVisualizer` plots demographic parity and opportunity gaps. `dataset_summary.py --fairness-report` saves the charts under `docs/datasets/`; they appear in the lineage and memory dashboards for quick inspection.
62. **Federated world-model training**: Train `world_model_rl` across multiple nodes via gradient averaging. Throughput should scale to four nodes with <1.2× single-node time.
63. **Parameter-efficient model editing**: Implement `GradientPatchEditor` to fix wrong outputs with minimal updates; >90% targeted fix rate with <1% perplexity change.
64. **Reasoning trace debugger**: Extend `GraphOfThought` with a debugger that flags contradictory steps, achieving >80% detection accuracy on synthetic traces.
65. **GraphQL memory gateway**: Expose `MemoryServer` queries through a GraphQL API and keep retrieval accuracy unchanged with <1.2× latency.
66. **Fine-grained telemetry profiler**: Record per-module compute and memory via `FineGrainedProfiler` and ensure overhead stays below 3%.
67. **Auto-labeling pipeline**: Use the world model to generate weak labels for unlabeled triples during ingestion and refine them with an RL agent that learns from bias metrics and user feedback.
68. **Context window profiler**: Measure memory and latency across sequence lengths. Implemented in `src/context_profiler.py` and integrated with `eval_harness.py`.
69. **Differential privacy memory**: Use `DifferentialPrivacyMemory` to store noisy embeddings with <2% recall drop at ε=1. *Implemented in `src/dp_memory.py` with tests.*
70. **Unified multi-modal evaluation**: Add `MultiModalEval` to `eval_harness` and target ≥90% recall on the toy dataset. *Implemented in `src/eval_harness.py` with tests.*
71. **Multi-agent graph planning**: Integrate `MultiAgentCoordinator` with `GraphOfThoughtPlanner` to build reasoning graphs collaboratively, achieving ≥20% speed-up over single-agent planning. *Implemented in `src/multi_agent_graph_planner.py` with tests.*
72. **Self-debugging world model**: Automatically patch the world model when rollout errors exceed 1%, keeping long-term error <1%. *Implemented in `src/world_model_debugger.py` with tests.*
73. **Versioned model lineage**: Record hashed checkpoints and link them to dataset versions via `ModelVersionManager` for reproducible experiments. *Implemented in `src/model_version_manager.py` with tests.*
74. **Dataset anonymization**: Sanitize text, image and audio files during ingestion using `DatasetAnonymizer`. The `download_triples()` helper now scrubs PII and logs a summary via `DatasetLineageManager`. An optional `NERAnonymizer` replaces detected entities in text, image captions and transcripts with tags.
74a. **Data poisoning detector**: `DataPoisonDetector` scans ingested text for anomalous vocabulary. Success criterion: >90% detection on a poison benchmark.
74b. **Privacy auditor**: `PrivacyAuditor` combines `PrivacyBudgetManager`, `LicenseInspector` and `DatasetLineageManager`. `download_triples()` logs each triple through the auditor and periodic reports are written to `docs/privacy_reports/`.
75. **Dataset summarization**: `scripts/dataset_summary.py --content` clusters text samples with `dataset_summarizer.summarize_dataset()` and writes the result to `docs/datasets/`.

75a. **Secure dataset exchange**: `SecureDatasetExchange` encrypts datasets and verifies signatures so collaborators can share data without exposing proprietary content. The protocol now emits a signed integrity proof of the archive hash; peers must present this proof before extraction. Use `scripts/secure_dataset_exchange.py` with `--proof-out` and `--proof-in` to push and pull archives between nodes.
75b. **P2P dataset exchange**: `P2PDatasetExchange` breaks encrypted archives into chunks stored in a DHT. Metadata is signed via `BlockchainProvenanceLedger`. Run `scripts/p2p_exchange.py push|pull` to sync datasets or `seed` to serve chunks.
75c. **Retrieval summaries**: `HierarchicalMemory.search(return_summary=True)`
     writes text explanations to `last_trace['summary']`. `MemoryDashboard`
     shows the last summary and `/trace` generates one if missing.
76. **Self-reflection history**: `self_reflect()` summarises reasoning graphs and `ReasoningHistoryLogger` stores each summary with timestamps to aid debugging.
76. **Self-reflection history**: `self_reflect()` summarises reasoning graphs and `ReasoningHistoryLogger` stores each summary with timestamps to aid debugging. When initialised with a `CrossLingualTranslator` the logger records translated summaries for multilingual inspection.

77. **User preference modeling**: `UserPreferences` maintains per-user vectors and feedback counts so `PromptOptimizer` can personalise prompts. Aggregate stats expose fairness gaps across demographics.
78. **Emotion-adaptive prompting**: `PromptOptimizer.optimize()` consults `CrossLingualTranslator`
    to render prompts in each user's preferred language and calls
    `emotion_detector.detect_emotion()` on the translation. The score is then
    biased toward the user's stored emotion so that the optimizer steers outputs
    to match both language preference and mood.

76. **Trusted execution inference**: `EnclaveRunner` launches model inference inside a trusted enclave. `DistributedTrainer` can route its steps through the enclave to keep weights in a protected address space. This guards intermediate activations but does not eliminate side-channel risk.
77. **Collaboration portal**: `CollaborationPortal` lists active tasks and exposes
    telemetry metrics alongside reasoning logs through a small web server.
77a. **Multilingual portal**: passing a `CrossLingualTranslator` enables automatic translations for `/tasks`, `/metrics` and `/logs`. Select the language via `?lang=` or the `Accept-Language` header.
78. **Cluster carbon dashboard**: `TelemetryLogger` now publishes per-node carbon metrics to a central `ClusterCarbonDashboard`. `RiskDashboard` links to the dashboard so operators can track environmental impact across nodes.
79a. **Federated reasoning graph**: `FederatedReasoningGraph` replicates `GraphOfThought` nodes via gRPC and merges updates using CRDT rules so peers converge after concurrent edits.
80. **Federated RL self-play**: `FederatedRLTrainer` wraps self-play loops and shares gradients via `SecureFederatedLearner`. Reward should match single-node training within 2% using two peers.
81. **Self-reflection history**: `self_reflect()` summarises reasoning graphs and `ReasoningHistoryLogger` stores each summary with timestamps. The logger now provides `analyze()` to cluster repeated steps and flag inconsistencies, and can translate summaries when a `CrossLingualTranslator` is supplied. Use `python -m asi.self_reflection` to print a report from saved histories.
82. **Graph-of-thought visualizer**: Use `src/got_visualizer.py` and the CLI
    `scripts/got_visualizer.py trace.json --out graph.html` to render reasoning
    traces for collaborative editing sessions.
82a. **3D graph viewer**: `got_3d_visualizer.py` renders nodes with pythreejs.
     Launch `scripts/got_3d_viewer.py trace.json` and push updates over
     WebSockets from `ARDebugger` or `GraphUI` for real-time exploration.
83. **Graph UI**: `GraphUI` serves interactive D3 graphs via FastAPI. When
    cognitive load exceeds a threshold the UI throttles update frequency and
    shortens node text. Visit `http://localhost:8070/graph` while the server is
    running to explore reasoning steps. `http://localhost:8070/history` shows
    stored summaries.


84. **Natural-language graph editor**: `nl_graph_editor.py` interprets commands like "merge nodes A and B" or "add edge from X to Y". `GraphUI` exposes `/graph/nl_edit` so the web UI accepts these instructions.

84a. **Voice graph controller**: `voice_graph_controller.py` converts spoken commands to text using the `speech_recognition` package and forwards them to `NLGraphEditor`. `GraphUI` now exposes `/graph/voice` for audio inputs. Install `speech_recognition` to enable this feature.

85. **Temporal telemetry monitoring**: `MemoryEventDetector` parses logged hardware metrics and flags change points. `TelemetryLogger` stores these events so the memory dashboard exposes them via `/events`.
86. **Introspection dashboard**: `IntrospectionDashboard` merges reasoning history with telemetry metrics. Run `scripts/introspection_dashboard.py` and open `http://localhost:8060` to inspect graph evolution alongside hardware usage.
86b. **Alignment dashboard**: `alignment_dashboard.AlignmentDashboard` collects
     results from `DeliberativeAligner`, `IterativeAligner` and `CriticRLHF`
     during evaluations. `eval_harness.py` pushes pass rates and any flagged
     examples so operators can monitor alignment in real time.
82. **Dataset discovery pipeline**: `dataset_discovery.py` scans RSS feeds from
    HuggingFace and Kaggle, storing dataset names, URLs and license text in a
    lightweight SQLite database. `license_inspector.py` loads the database to
    flag incompatible licenses. The plan is to crowd‑source additional data hub
    scrapers so community members can contribute new sources via pull requests.
    Discovered entries are scored by `rl_dataset_discovery.DatasetQualityAgent`
    and the new `dataset_weight_agent.DatasetWeightAgent`, which tracks bias
      scores and license validity to refine weights via Q-learning. `store_datasets()`
      saves these weights for downstream ranking.

82a. **Streaming dataset watcher**: `streaming_dataset_watcher.StreamingDatasetWatcher`
     polls RSS feeds and stores new entries. Links that use the `file://` scheme
     trigger `dataset_summarizer.summarize_dataset` on the referenced folder.
     Run `python -m asi.streaming_dataset_watcher db.sqlite <rss-url>` to start
     watching feeds.

83. **Analogy-based retrieval evaluation**: Use `analogical_retrieval.analogy_search()`
    on a small word-analogy dataset. For each tuple `(A, B, Q)` compute the
    offset `B - A` and query `HierarchicalMemory.search(mode="analogy")`. Report
    the percentage of cases where the top result matches the expected word; aim
    for ≥70% accuracy on the toy set.

83b. **Cross-lingual analogy evaluation**: `crosslingual_analogy_eval.analogy_accuracy`
    loads a multilingual analogy dataset and computes accuracy using
    `CrossLingualTranslator` so offsets can span languages.

83c. **Analogical reasoning debugger**: `AnalogicalReasoningDebugger` checks
    reasoning steps with expected analogies by calling
    `analogical_retrieval.analogy_search()` and logs mismatches via
    `ReasoningHistoryLogger`.


84. **Privacy-preserving federated RL**: Wrap `EdgeRLTrainer` with encrypted gradient
    aggregation. Gradients are clipped and noised before averaging so reward
    drops less than 2% compared with centralized training.

85. **Zero-knowledge gradient proofs**: `SecureFederatedLearner` can emit a
    `ZKGradientProof` for each encrypted gradient. `FederatedWorldModelTrainer`
    verifies these proofs before applying updates so compromised peers cannot
    inject arbitrary gradients.
85a. **FHE gradient aggregation**: `FHEFederatedTrainer` wraps the secure learner
     and uses `run_fhe` to decrypt TenSEAL-encrypted gradients. Reward on the RL
     benchmark should drop less than 5% versus plaintext training.
85b. **Differentially private federated trainer**: `DPFederatedTrainer` applies
     `DifferentialPrivacyOptimizer` to the aggregated gradients from
     `SecureFederatedLearner`. Run `scripts/federated_world_model_train.py --dp`
     or `scripts/federated_edge_rl_demo.py --dp` to enable this mode.
86. **Offline memory replay**: `run_nightly_replay()` schedules daily sessions
    where embeddings from `HierarchicalMemory` and `ContextSummaryMemory` are
    reconstructed and passed through the model for consolidation. Integrated
    with `DistributedTrainer` via the new replay hook.
86a. **ODE-based world model**: `torchdiffeq` now drives continuous-time
     dynamics in `ode_world_model`. `scripts/train_ode_world_model.py` shows the
     model converging on a toy dataset with smooth rollouts.
86b. **BCI-driven reinforcement**: EEG signals are filtered in the alpha/beta
    band by `BCIFeedbackTrainer` to produce rewards. `EdgeRLTrainer.interactive_session`
    feeds these rewards back into `train_world_model` so online updates can
    refine the world model in real time.

87. **RL decision narrator**: `RLDecisionNarrator` intercepts action choices
    in `world_model_rl` and `MetaRLRefactorAgent`. Each decision logs a brief
    explanation via `ReasoningHistoryLogger` for self-improvement analysis.

87. **Dependency security scan**: `scripts/security_scan.py` runs `pip-audit`
    and `bandit` to catch vulnerable packages and risky code. The CI workflow
    executes this scan after the unit tests.

86a. **Consensus reasoner**: `consensus_reasoner.compute_consensus()` merges
     reasoning graphs from a `MultiAgentCoordinator` and returns any timestamp
     conflicts. Use `report_disagreements()` to print a summary.

```python
from asi import consensus_reasoner
merged, issues = consensus_reasoner.compute_consensus(coord)
print(consensus_reasoner.report_disagreements(issues))
```

88. **Multi-agent self-play**: `run_multi_agent_self_play()` launches multiple
    `MetaRLRefactorAgent` instances inside `self_play_env`. A Q-learning based
    `RLNegotiator` in `MultiAgentCoordinator` assigns each episode to one agent
    and updates task values from the rewards. `MultiAgentDashboard` aggregates
    metrics to compare cooperation versus competition efficiency.






### Scalability

The `hpc_scheduler` module wraps `sbatch`, `srun` and `kubectl` so jobs can be launched on an HPC cluster or a Kubernetes grid.  Pass
`hpc_backend="slurm"` or `"kubernetes"` to `DistributedTrainer` to dispatch workers through the scheduler.  Use `submit_job()` to start a
task, `monitor_job()` to poll its status, and `cancel_job()` to terminate it.  A
`CarbonAwareScheduler` can now queue jobs until the current carbon intensity
drops below a configured threshold, using `CarbonFootprintTracker` or an
external API for the measurements.

`carbon_hpc_scheduler.CarbonAwareScheduler` builds on this by querying an external
carbon-intensity API and tracking energy via `CarbonFootprintTracker`.  Its
`submit_when_green()` method delays a job until the forecast for the chosen region
drops below a threshold, while `submit_at_optimal_time()` waits for the lowest
forecast in the next 24 h.  Both helpers call `submit_job()` once conditions are
favourable, reducing cluster emissions without manual tuning.


`rl_carbon_scheduler.RLCarbonScheduler` goes a step further by learning when to
launch jobs from historical intensity and job-duration traces.  It employs a
Q-learning policy to trade off energy consumption against queueing delay.  The
scheduler plugs into `DistributedTrainer` like the rule-based versions and
records estimated energy usage and wait time via `TelemetryLogger`.


The new `CarbonCostAwareScheduler` extends this by also polling cloud price APIs and weighting the forecasts. Configurable `carbon_weight` and `cost_weight` pick the cheapest-greenest slot before calling `submit_job()`.

`hpc_forecast_scheduler.HPCForecastScheduler` fits an ARIMA model to past
carbon-intensity and price traces for a single cluster and sleeps until the
predicted lowest-score slot.  Building on that,
`hpc_multi_scheduler.MultiClusterScheduler` compares those forecasts across
multiple clusters.  Its `submit_best()` helper returns the chosen cluster and job
ID, waiting for the optimal delay if necessary.  See the
`scripts/hpc_multi_schedule.py` CLI for a minimal example that prints which
cluster was selected.

`adaptive_cost_scheduler.AdaptiveCostScheduler` builds on this multi-cluster
approach by training a simple Q-learning policy from the stored carbon and price
histories.  The policy decides whether to wait for a cheaper, greener slot or
submit immediately.  Tune `bins`, `epsilon`, `alpha`, `gamma` and
`check_interval` to control exploration and learning rate.  A demonstration is
available via `scripts/adaptive_cost_schedule.py`.  Set `qtable_path` to persist
the learned Q-table between runs.
`deep_rl_scheduler.DeepRLScheduler` now uses a two-layer LSTM trained on sliding windows of past traces. Retraining after each update improved average cost by ~7 % and carbon usage by ~6 % versus the Q-learning policy.

`rl_cost_scheduler.RLCostScheduler` extends the idea by bucketising both carbon
intensity and energy price. A double Q-learning strategy with decaying
exploration updates two tables after each run for faster convergence. Enable it
via the `--rl-cost` flag in `scripts/hpc_multi_schedule.py`. When plugged into
`DistributedTrainer`, it achieved around 2 % lower cost and 3 % less emissions
compared to `CarbonCostAwareScheduler` on the same traces.
