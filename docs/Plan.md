Below is a **shopping list of concrete algorithmic gaps** that must be closed on the road from
today’s LLMs to a self-improving Artificial Super-Intelligence (ASI).  Each entry names the
*exact algorithm (or family)*, why it matters, and what new result would count as “solved”.
Citations point to the most recent public work so you can drill straight into the details.

## 1  Scaling-Efficiency Algorithms

| ID      | Algorithm-to-solve                                  | What it must do                                                                                | Success criterion                                                                                        |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **S-1** | **Sparse Mixture-of-Experts Routing (Switch-type)** | Activate ≤2 experts/token with *O*(1) router cost; keep cross-expert load-balance ≤3 % std-dev | 10 × parameter-count growth *without* >1.3 × training FLOPs ([medium.com][1])                            |
| **S-2** | **FlashAttention-3 kernel**                         | Exact soft-max attention in fused CUDA/ROCm kernel with block-wise recomputation               | ≥90 % GPU util. for 8 k→1 M tokens, Wall-time speed-up ≥2 × over FA-2 ([tridao.me][2])                   |
| **S-3** | **Scaling-law breakpoint model**                    | Predict test-loss vs (model, data, compute) past the current “diminishing-returns knee”        | Empirically fit to ≥3 new models above 3 T params; error <10 % ([businessinsider.com][3], [time.com][4]) |
| **S-4** | **4-bit Quantized LoRA Training**                   | Train LoRA-adapted models entirely in 4-bit weights                | ≤50 % memory of FP16 baseline at equal accuracy on 1 B+ params |

**Take-away:**  Parameter-scaling alone still improves raw capability, but returns are now *sub-linear*; the industry is already in the knee of the curve.  Architectural and data-efficiency gains (S-1, S-2) therefore matter more than brute size.

| **C-10** | **RL-guided retrieval** | Learn a policy to rank memory vectors by hit rate and latency | Recall improves after online training from query logs |

**Path to “trillion-token” context:** combine *C-1/2/3* for linear-or-sub-linear scaling, add **hierarchical retrieval** (store distant tokens in an external vector DB and re-inject on-demand).  Recurrence handles the whole stream; retrieval gives random access—context length becomes limited only by storage, not RAM.  Privacy-preserving retrieval is now possible via `EncryptedVectorStore`, which stores AES-encrypted embeddings and manages keys through `HierarchicalMemory`.

## 6  Will “just scaling Transformers” reach ASI?

* Empirical scaling-law fits (S-3) and industry reports show *sharp diminishing returns* past the multi-trillion-parameter scale ([pnas.org][22], [time.com][4]).
* **Therefore:** Raw scaling is **necessary but not sufficient**.  Breakthroughs in *long-term memory (Section 2)*, *autonomous self-improvement (Section 3)*, and *robust alignment (Section 4)* are all required to bridge the gap to ASI.

---

### Practical roadmap to “infinite” context

1. **Linear-time backbone** (Mamba / RetNet).
2. **Streaming compression**: reservoir sampling + learned lossy compress to keep working set ≤O(log T).
3. **Hierarchical memory**: SSD-based vector store with learnable “link slots” (top-k retrieval).
4. **Chunk-wise retraining**: periodically fine-tune on *own* long-horizon transcripts to internalise far-past facts (solve catastrophic forgetting).

Combine 1-4 and the *effective* context limit becomes hardware bandwidth, not model design—conceptually “infinite”.

---

### Bottom line

* **Transformers will stay in the loop**, but solving *S-1 → S-3* + *C-1 → C-6* is what lifts the ceiling.
* **Quantum speed-ups (A-4)** slash search times yet do **not** remove the need for the safety stack (*L-1 → L-4*).
* When these algorithmic boxes are all ticked—and only then—scaling the system as a whole (not just the parameters) gives you a credible trajectory toward ASI.

### Current progress

- Prototype modules for **S-1** and **S-2** have been added in `src/`.
- `src/moe_router.py` offers `HashRouter` and a `SwitchRouter` with learned gating and load-balance reporting.
- The router now accepts a `temperature` parameter and exposes `balance_loss_probs()` and
  `token_drop_rate()` metrics. With `temperature=0.7`, `scripts/benchmark_moe.py` reports
  load-balance std around **0.02**.
- `src/moe_layer.py` defines a simple MoE feed-forward layer using those routers.
- `src/flash_attention3.py` wraps the FlashAttention‑3 kernel and exposes `_HAS_FLASH3`.

- `src/scaling_law.py` implements a `BreakpointScalingLaw` model for the **S-3**
  scaling-law breakpoint task.
- `src/scaling_breakpoint.py` provides a light-weight `fit_breakpoint()` helper
  that returns a dataclass `BreakpointModel` with piecewise slopes.

  disk-backed `FaissVectorStore`.
- `src/hierarchical_memory.py` ties compression and retrieval together for
  hierarchical context. With a database path it hooks into FAISS so far-past
  tokens reload from disk automatically. Search results remain on the
  same device as the query.
- `src/link_slot_attention.py` implements retrieval-augmented attention that
  fetches top-k vectors from the hierarchical memory for each token.
- `src/megabyte_patching.py` adds a hierarchical byte patcher for **C-4**.

- `src/paper_to_code.py` transpiles LaTeX pseudo-code to Python for **A-1**.
- `src/autobench.py` runs isolated test modules for **A-2** and
  `summarize_results()` prints a concise scoreboard with snippets from failing
  outputs.
- `src/meta_rl_refactor.py` implements a small Q-learning agent for **A-3**.
- `src/quantum_hpo.py` provides a quantum amplitude-estimation search for **A-4**. It now accepts architecture parameters to evaluate candidate transformer components.

- `src/iter_align.py` runs a simple iterative alignment loop for **L-3**.
- `src/critic_rlhf.py` provides a minimal critic-driven RLHF loop for **L-4**.
  See `docs/Implementation.md` and `docs/load_balance.md` for details.
- `src/pull_request_monitor.py` now supports asynchronous GitHub queries using
  `aiohttp` for faster monitoring of open pull requests.
- `src/lora_quant.py` provides 4-bit LoRA adapters and `apply_quant_lora()` to
  inject them into existing models.
- `src/spiking_layers.py` defines `LIFNeuron` and `SpikingLinear`. Set
  `use_spiking=True` in `MultiModalWorldModelConfig` to replace MLP blocks with
  these energy-efficient neurons.
- `src/cross_modal_fusion.py` encodes text, images and audio in a shared space
  with a contrastive training helper.
- `src/multimodal_world_model.py` unifies these embeddings with actions for
  world-model rollouts.

- `src/self_play_env.py` and `src/embodied_calibration.py` offer a sandbox for
  self-play and a sensor calibration routine.
- `src/formal_verifier.py` checks model snapshots against custom invariants.
- `src/eval_harness.py` aggregates metrics from all modules and prints a pass/fail scoreboard. The CLI now supports a `--concurrent` flag to run evaluations asynchronously via `evaluate_modules_async()`.
- `scripts/distributed_eval.py` runs the harness across multiple processes or hosts and aggregates the results for large-scale testing.
- `src/transformer_circuits.py` records attention weights and lets researchers ablate individual heads for interpretability experiments.

### Recommended next steps

- **Pinpoint a high-impact algorithm** from the tables above. Unsolved entries
  under Sections 1–3 yield the biggest leverage on capability.
- **Survey the latest papers** referenced in each section to understand the
  current state of the art and gaps that remain.
- **Formulate a clear research question** that ties the algorithm to a concrete
  success criterion from the table.
- **Prototype using the existing modules** in `src/` and keep the code modular
  so new components plug into the test suite.
- **Run `pytest`** after any code change to ensure baseline stability before
  measuring performance on benchmarks.
- **Document findings** in this file and in `docs/Implementation.md` so others
  can reproduce the experiments and build upon them.

### Short-Term Research Tasks

1. **Hybrid retention backbone**: Fuse `RetNetRetention` with `MambaBlock` and
   measure throughput and memory compared with the individual kernels.
   *Implemented in `src/hybrid_retention.py` with unit tests.*
2. **Cross-modal retrieval memory**: Store embeddings from
   `cross_modal_fusion.encode_all()` inside `HierarchicalMemory` and evaluate
   retrieval accuracy on 1&nbsp;M-token streams. *Implemented via
   `add_multimodal()` in `cross_modal_fusion.py` and related unit tests.*
3. **LoRA-quantized world model**: *Implemented* via a `use_lora` option in
   `multimodal_world_model.py` which wraps the transformer layers with
   quantized adapters.
4. **QAE-guided refactoring**: Employ `QAEHyperparamSearch` to tune exploration
   parameters in `MetaRLRefactorAgent` and track benchmark uplift.
5. **Scalability metrics**: *(done)* `eval_harness.py` now records GPU memory
   usage via `log_memory_usage()` and prints it alongside pass/fail results.
6. **Compute budget tracking**: Use `ComputeBudgetTracker` to log GPU hours and
   energy cost for each run and stop training when the budget is exhausted.
7. **Budget-aware scheduler**: Automatically lower batch size and learning rate
   via `BudgetAwareScheduler` when `remaining()` falls below a threshold.
8. **Distributed memory benchmark**: Run `DistributedMemory` with four
   `MemoryServer` nodes using `distributed_memory_benchmark.py` and measure
   query latency and throughput versus the single-node baseline.
9. **MemoryServer streaming API**: Benchmark the new batched push/query
   endpoints and report latency savings over single-vector calls.
10. **Checkpointed world model**: *(done)* the multimodal world model now
   supports a `checkpoint_blocks` flag which reduces memory usage during
   training.
11. **Self-play dataset fusion**: *(implemented)* `train_with_self_play` records
   trajectories from `self_play_skill_loop.run_loop` and feeds them into
   `train_world_model` for mixed-modality experiments.
12. **Attention trace analysis**: Use the new `AttentionVisualizer` to
   inspect long-context retrieval patterns on ≥1&nbsp;M-token evaluations.
    `RetrievalExplainer` extends `HierarchicalMemory.search()` with similarity scores and provenance so these traces are visible through the memory dashboard.
13. **Graph-of-thought planning**: Implement `GraphOfThought` (see
    `src/graph_of_thought.py`) and measure refactor quality gains over the
    baseline meta-RL agent. The `ReasoningDebugger` now aggregates loops and
    contradictions across multiple agents.

    in a `DistributedTrainer` that automatically resumes from failures.
    *Implemented in `src/distributed_trainer.py` with integration tests.*
14. **Edge-memory virtualization**: Stream context from `HierarchicalMemory`
    through `RemoteMemory` so low-memory devices can handle large-context
    inference. *Implemented in `src/edge_memory_client.py` with tests.*
15. **Adaptive curriculum scheduler**: Mix curated datasets with self-play logs
    via reinforcement learning to accelerate skill acquisition. Implemented in
    `adaptive_curriculum.py` and used by `self_play_skill_loop`.
16. **Quantum architecture search**: Extend `QAEHyperparamSearch` to explore
    novel transformer components and report promising variants.
    *Implemented in `src/quantum_hpo.py` with unit tests.*
17. **Elastic mixture-of-experts routing**: *Implemented in `src/elastic_moe_router.py`.*
    The router varies active expert counts based on GPU load and compares load
    balance with the static `SwitchRouter`.
18. **SSD-backed retrieval cache**: Extend `HierarchicalMemory` with an
    `SSDCache` that prefetches frequently accessed vectors for low-latency
    retrieval. *Implemented in `src/hierarchical_memory.py`.*
19. **Adaptive eviction policy**: `HierarchicalMemory` now tracks hit/miss rates
    and adjusts `evict_limit` automatically. Use `adaptive_evict=True` to enable
    and inspect stats via `get_stats()`.
20. **Generative noise filtering**: `AutoDatasetFilter` now runs during data
    ingest to prune low-quality samples using generative noise detection and
    track the effect on training stability.
21. **Generative data augmentor**: Use `GenerativeDataAugmentor` to synthesize
    new training triples from world-model rollouts and expand the dataset. When
    paired with `DiffusionWorldModel`, the augmentor samples diverse environment
    states to improve world-model coverage. The module integrates with
    `data_ingest` for easy ingestion.
22. **Continuous evaluation**: Run `continuous_eval.py` after each pull request
    to track benchmark progress automatically. *Implemented in
    `scripts/continuous_eval.py`.*
23. **Continuous adversarial evaluation**: Schedule adversarial tests via
    `AdversarialRobustnessScheduler` and log metrics in
    `scripts/continuous_eval.py`.
24. **Adaptive planning agent**: Merge `GraphOfThoughtPlanner` with
    `MetaRLRefactorAgent` to auto-rank refactor strategies. *Implemented in
    `src/adaptive_planner.py`.*
25. **Neural architecture search**: Evaluate `src/neural_arch_search.py` across
    candidate module configurations and report accuracy vs. compute costs.
    *Implemented in `src/neural_arch_search.py`.*
25. **Self-healing distributed training**: Deploy `SelfHealingTrainer` to
    restart failed jobs automatically and track overall utilization.
    *Implemented in `src/self_healing_trainer.py`.*
26. **World-model data synthesis**: Use the `offline_synthesizer` to generate
    synthetic multimodal triples and measure retrieval improvements. *Implemented
    in `data_ingest.offline_synthesizer`.*
27. **Federated memory exchange**: Synchronize retrieval vectors across
    multiple `MemoryServer` nodes and benchmark cross-node accuracy.
    *Implemented in `src/federated_memory_exchange.py` with
    `scripts/federated_memory_sync.py`.*
28. **Causal graph learner**: Train `CausalGraphLearner` on `world_model_rl`
    transitions and report planning gains from the inferred edges.
    *Implemented in `src/causal_graph_learner.py`.*
29. **Structured knowledge graph memory**: Store facts as triples in a `KnowledgeGraphMemory` and retrieve them through `HierarchicalMemory` for better planning context.
    The new `GraphNeuralReasoner` loads these triples and predicts missing relations so `HierarchicalPlanner.query_relation()` can infer edges not explicitly stored.
    `KnowledgeGraphMemory` now records optional timestamps per triple and supports temporal range queries for time-sensitive reasoning.
29. **Temporal reasoner**: `TemporalReasoner` queries these timestamped triples
    to infer before/after relationships. `HierarchicalPlanner.compose_plan()`
    can optionally reorder intermediate steps using the reasoner for time-aware
    planning.
29. **Self-alignment evaluator**: Integrate
    `deliberative_alignment.check_alignment()` into `eval_harness` and track
    alignment metrics alongside existing benchmarks. *Implemented in
    `src/eval_harness.py` as `SelfAlignmentEvaluator`.*

30. **Federated memory backend**: Implement a `FederatedMemoryServer` that
    replicates vector stores across peers via gRPC streaming consensus for
    decentralized retrieval. The service now exposes a `Sync` RPC and uses
    CRDT update rules so that multiple servers converge on identical vector
    stores after exchanging updates.
31. **Active data selection**: Add an `ActiveDataSelector` to score incoming
    triples by predictive entropy and keep only high-information samples.
    *Implemented in `data_ingest.ActiveDataSelector`.*
32. **Hierarchical graph planner**: Combine `GraphOfThought` with
    `world_model_rl.rollout_policy` to generate multi-stage plans for
    refactoring and exploration.
33. **Differential privacy optimizer**: Integrate gradient clipping and noise
    injection into training loops so models can train with privacy guarantees.
34. **LSH retrieval index**: Add `LocalitySensitiveHashIndex` in `vector_store.py` so
    `HierarchicalMemory` can perform approximate nearest neighbor search with
    sub-linear query time.
35. **Embedding visualizer**: Build a module to project cross-modal embeddings using UMAP/t-SNE and expose the plots via a lightweight web viewer. Implemented in `src/embedding_visualizer.py`.
36. **Multi-agent coordinator**: Prototype a `MultiAgentCoordinator` that
    synchronizes multiple refactor agents and schedules collaborative
    improvements across repositories.
37. **Compressed vector store**: Implement a `PQVectorStore` using FAISS `IndexIVFPQ`
    and integrate with `HierarchicalMemory`. Benchmark retrieval accuracy vs.
    `FaissVectorStore`.
38. **Duplicate data filter**: Use CLIP embeddings with locality-sensitive
    hashing to drop near-duplicate samples during ingestion and connect it to
    `AutoDatasetFilter`.
39. **Temporal decay memory**: Add a `TemporalVectorCompressor` that weights
    embeddings by recency. Evaluate retrieval accuracy drop <3% compared with
    the existing `StreamingCompressor` on 1&nbsp;M-token streams.
40. **Cross-lingual data ingestion**: Integrate a `CrossLingualTranslator`
    into `data_ingest` so text is stored in multiple languages. *Implemented*
    via the optional ``translator`` argument of ``download_triples()`` which
    saves translated files alongside the originals. Translated triples are now
    passed through `cross_modal_fusion.encode_all()` and their fused embeddings
    are stored in `HierarchicalMemory` with language tags for language-agnostic
    retrieval.
    so queries in any supported language return the same results. The optional
    `CrossLingualSpeechTranslator` transcribes audio queries offline and feeds
    the text through `CrossLingualTranslator` for unified search.
41a. **Cross-lingual summarization memory**: `ContextSummaryMemory` stores summaries
     in the source language and translated forms. Results are translated back
     to the query language. See `docs/Implementation.md` for details.
42. **World-model distillation**: Implement a `WorldModelDistiller` that
    compresses the large world model into a smaller student network. Target
    <5% reward loss on the embodied RL benchmarks while reducing model size by
    ≥4×.

43. **Summarizing memory compression**: Condense rarely accessed vectors with a small language model before persisting them to disk. Success is a ≥50 % reduction in storage while retrieval accuracy drops <5 %.
44. **Telemetry instrumentation**: Record GPU/CPU utilization and network throughput across distributed nodes using OpenTelemetry and expose the metrics via Prometheus. Overhead must remain <5 % on a 4-node cluster. *`MemoryServer` now accepts a `TelemetryLogger` to start and stop metrics automatically.*
45. **Memory usage dashboard**: Aggregate telemetry from multiple memory nodes and present hit/miss rates in real time.
46. **License compliance checker**: Parse dataset sources for license text during ingestion and block incompatible samples. Every stored triple should include a valid license entry.
47. **Adaptive streaming compression**: Add `AdaptiveCompressor` to adjust the compression ratio in `StreamingCompressor` based on retrieval frequency.
48. **Prompt optimization**: Build a `PromptOptimizer` that learns prompt revisions via reinforcement learning and measure evaluation gains.
49. **Training anomaly detection**: Extend `SelfHealingTrainer` with a `TrainingAnomalyDetector` to roll back or restart runs when metrics diverge.
50. **Parameter-efficient adaptation**: Explore low-rank fine-tuning across tasks; success is matching baseline accuracy with ≤10% extra parameters.
51. **Context summarization memory**: Store compressed summaries for distant tokens and re-expand them on demand; success is >95% retrieval accuracy at 100× token length. *Implemented in `src/context_summary_memory.py` with tests.*
52. **Dataset lineage manager**: Automatically track dataset versions and transformations, enabling reproducible training pipelines. *Implemented in `src/dataset_lineage_manager.py`.*
    Use `DataProvenanceLedger` to append a signed hash of each lineage record. Run `scripts/check_provenance.py <root>` to verify the ledger.
53. **Multi-stage oversight**: Combine constitutional AI, deliberative alignment, and critic-in-the-loop RLHF with formal verification; success is <1% harmful output on the existing benchmarks.
54. **Self-supervised sensorimotor pretraining**: Pretrain the embodied world model on large unlabelled multimodal logs; success is 20% fewer real-world samples to reach 90% task success.
55. **Gradient compression for distributed training**: Implement a `GradientCompressor`
    with top-k sparsification or quantized gradients and integrate it with
    `DistributedTrainer`.
56. **ONNX export**: Provide `export_to_onnx()` and a script to save `MultiModalWorldModel` and `CrossModalFusion` as ONNX graphs.
57. **Memory profiling**: Instrument `HierarchicalMemory` with a lightweight profiler that records query counts, hit/miss ratios and latency.
58. **Secure federated learner**: Train models across remote peers using encrypted gradient aggregation. Accuracy should stay within 2% of centralized training.
59. **GPU-aware scheduler**: Monitor GPU memory and compute load to dispatch jobs dynamically. Combined with `ComputeBudgetTracker`, the new `AdaptiveScheduler` automatically pauses or resumes runs based on remaining GPU hours and historical improvement. *Carbon-intensity data now guide the scheduler to prefer lower-emission nodes, reducing the environmental footprint.*
60. **Adversarial robustness suite**: Generate gradient-based adversarial prompts and measure model degradation. Acceptable drop is <5% accuracy on the evaluation harness.
61. **Bias-aware dataset filtering**: Add `DatasetBiasDetector` to compute representation metrics and filter skewed samples. Goal is <5% disparity across demographic slices after filtering.
62. **Federated world-model training**: Train `world_model_rl` across multiple nodes via gradient averaging. Throughput should scale to four nodes with <1.2× single-node time.
63. **Parameter-efficient model editing**: Implement `GradientPatchEditor` to fix wrong outputs with minimal updates; >90% targeted fix rate with <1% perplexity change.
64. **Reasoning trace debugger**: Extend `GraphOfThought` with a debugger that flags contradictory steps, achieving >80% detection accuracy on synthetic traces.
65. **GraphQL memory gateway**: Expose `MemoryServer` queries through a GraphQL API and keep retrieval accuracy unchanged with <1.2× latency.
66. **Fine-grained telemetry profiler**: Record per-module compute and memory via `FineGrainedProfiler` and ensure overhead stays below 3%.
67. **Auto-labeling pipeline**: Use the world model to generate weak labels for unlabeled triples during ingestion and measure dataset quality improvements.
68. **Context window profiler**: Measure memory and latency across sequence lengths. Implemented in `src/context_profiler.py` and integrated with `eval_harness.py`.
69. **Differential privacy memory**: Use `DifferentialPrivacyMemory` to store noisy embeddings with <2% recall drop at ε=1. *Implemented in `src/dp_memory.py` with tests.*
70. **Unified multi-modal evaluation**: Add `MultiModalEval` to `eval_harness` and target ≥90% recall on the toy dataset. *Implemented in `src/eval_harness.py` with tests.*
71. **Multi-agent graph planning**: Integrate `MultiAgentCoordinator` with `GraphOfThoughtPlanner` to build reasoning graphs collaboratively, achieving ≥20% speed-up over single-agent planning. *Implemented in `src/multi_agent_graph_planner.py` with tests.*
72. **Self-debugging world model**: Automatically patch the world model when rollout errors exceed 1%, keeping long-term error <1%. *Implemented in `src/world_model_debugger.py` with tests.*
73. **Versioned model lineage**: Record hashed checkpoints and link them to dataset versions via `ModelVersionManager` for reproducible experiments. *Implemented in `src/model_version_manager.py` with tests.*
74. **Dataset anonymization**: Sanitize text, image and audio files during ingestion using `DatasetAnonymizer`. The `download_triples()` helper now scrubs PII and logs a summary via `DatasetLineageManager`.
75. **Self-reflection history**: `self_reflect()` summarises reasoning graphs and `ReasoningHistoryLogger` stores each summary with timestamps to aid debugging.

76. **Temporal telemetry monitoring**: `MemoryEventDetector` parses logged hardware metrics and flags change points. `TelemetryLogger` stores these events so the memory dashboard exposes them via `/events`.
76. **Trusted execution inference**: `EnclaveRunner` launches model inference inside a trusted enclave. `DistributedTrainer` can route its steps through the enclave to keep weights in a protected address space. This guards intermediate activations but does not eliminate side-channel risk.
77. **Collaboration portal**: `CollaborationPortal` lists active tasks and exposes
    telemetry metrics alongside reasoning logs through a small web server.
78. **Cluster carbon dashboard**: `TelemetryLogger` now publishes per-node carbon metrics to a central `ClusterCarbonDashboard`. `RiskDashboard` links to the dashboard so operators can track environmental impact across nodes.
79. **Federated knowledge graph memory**: Replicate triples across nodes via `FederatedKGMemoryServer` so that after network partitions all servers agree on the same graph. Success is 100% retrieval consistency across two peers after concurrent updates.
80. **Federated RL self-play**: `FederatedRLTrainer` wraps self-play loops and shares gradients via `SecureFederatedLearner`. Reward should match single-node training within 2% using two peers.
81. **Self-reflection history**: `self_reflect()` summarises reasoning graphs and `ReasoningHistoryLogger` stores each summary with timestamps. The logger now provides `analyze()` to cluster repeated steps and flag inconsistencies. Use `python -m asi.self_reflection` to print a report from saved histories.



### Scalability

The `hpc_scheduler` module wraps `sbatch`, `srun` and `kubectl` so jobs can be launched on an HPC cluster or a Kubernetes grid.  Pass
`hpc_backend="slurm"` or `"kubernetes"` to `DistributedTrainer` to dispatch workers through the scheduler.  Use `submit_job()` to start a
task, `monitor_job()` to poll its status, and `cancel_job()` to terminate it.
