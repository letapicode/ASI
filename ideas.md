# Feature Reasoning

## PR 1

### Repository Task List
- **What it does**: `parallel_tasks.md` lists a dedicated review task for every file.
- **Inputs/Outputs**: Inputs are file paths; output is a markdown checklist of tasks.
- **Alternative Approaches**: Could focus only on priority modules, but listing every file ensures nothing is overlooked. It was chosen to systematically cover the entire codebase.
- **Challenges**: The repository contains hundreds of files, so auto-generating the list was necessary.
- **ASI Connection**: Comprehensive review tasks help maintain high-quality code needed for reliable self-improving AI algorithms.

### PR Summary Requirement
- **What it does**: `AGENTS.md` now mandates a summary of what changed, how, and why in `steps_summary.md` for each PR.
- **Inputs/Outputs**: Input is developer actions; output is a markdown record of those actions.
- **Alternative Approaches**: Could rely on commit messages only, but a centralized summary improves clarity across iterations.
- **Challenges**: Ensuring contributors consistently update the summary; documenting this in the guidelines helps reinforce the habit.
- **ASI Connection**: Clear documentation of decision rationale supports collective understanding and efficient collaboration, which are vital for building ASI.

### Steps Summary Document
- **What it does**: Captures chronological notes about each PR.
- **Inputs/Outputs**: Inputs are PR actions; output is the `steps_summary.md` log.
- **Alternative Approaches**: Could use a changelog or release notes, but this summary focuses on developer reasoning rather than release versions.
- **Challenges**: Keeping the summary concise yet informative.
- **ASI Connection**: Provides transparency on the evolution of algorithms and tooling, aiding future contributors in building towards self-improvement.
