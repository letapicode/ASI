# Development Steps Summary

## PR 1
- Added a bullet in `AGENTS.md` requiring each pull request to summarize what changed, how it was done, and why, recorded in `steps_summary.md`.
- Generated `parallel_tasks.md` enumerating a review task for every file in the repository. Each task instructs contributors to analyze code quality, docs, and tests.
- Created this `steps_summary.md` to document the steps themselves.
- Added `ideas.md` to capture reasoning behind feature additions and their connection to ASI goals.

## PR 2
- Refined the bullet in `AGENTS.md` describing the PR summary requirement for brevity.
- Updated Task 1 in `parallel_tasks.md` with concrete review notes for `AGENTS.md`.
- Documented these adjustments in this file.
