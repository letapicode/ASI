# Development Steps Summary

## PR 1
- Added a bullet in `AGENTS.md` requiring each pull request to summarize what changed, how it was done, and why, recorded in `steps_summary.md`.
- Generated `parallel_tasks.md` enumerating a review task for every file in the repository. Each task instructs contributors to analyze code quality, docs, and tests.
- Created this `steps_summary.md` to document the steps themselves.
- Added `ideas.md` to capture reasoning behind feature additions and their connection to ASI goals.

## PR 2
- Refined the bullet in `AGENTS.md` describing the PR summary requirement for brevity.
- Updated Task 1 in `parallel_tasks.md` with concrete review notes for `AGENTS.md`.
- Documented these adjustments in this file.

## PR 3
- Introduced `graph_visualizer_base.py` with helper functions for reading graph JSON, layout calculations and a reusable `WebSocketServer`.
- Refactored `got_visualizer.py`, `got_3d_visualizer.py`, and `ar_got_overlay.py` to use the new helpers, eliminating duplicated code and adding fallback imports for tests.
- Updated `docs/Plan.md` with a bullet about the shared base module.

## PR 4
- Created `cross_lingual_utils.embed_text` as shared deterministic text embedding helper.
- Updated `cross_lingual_memory.py` and `cross_lingual_graph.py` to import this function instead of local implementations.
- Adjusted tests to rely on the new module.

## PR 5
- Introduced `hpc_base_scheduler.HPCBaseScheduler` to handle job queueing and submission.
- Added `ArimaStrategy` and `GNNStrategy` as pluggable forecast components used by the base class.
- Refactored `hpc_forecast_scheduler.py` and `hpc_gnn_scheduler.py` to inherit from the base scheduler.
- Simplified `hpc_multi_scheduler.py` by calling `forecast_scores()` directly on each scheduler instance.
- Documented the new architecture in `docs/Plan.md`.
