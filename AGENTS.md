# AGENTS Instructions

This repository hosts prototypes and docs for self-improving AI. The main plan lives in `docs/Plan.md`.

## Editing guidelines

- Use Markdown formatting.
- Keep lines under 120 characters where possible.
- Avoid trailing whitespace.
- Reference or update `docs/Plan.md` where relevant.
- Commit messages should start with a short summary in the imperative mood, e.g. `Add section on scalability`.

## Testing

A minimal test suite lives in `tests/`. Run `pytest` when modifying code.
Documentation-only changes do not require running tests.
