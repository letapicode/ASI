# AGENTS Instructions

This repository contains documentation on algorithms towards self-improving AI. The main content lives in `docs/Plan.md`.

## Editing guidelines

- Use Markdown formatting.
- Keep lines under 120 characters where possible.
- Avoid trailing whitespace.
- Reference or update `docs/Plan.md` where relevant.
- Commit messages should start with a short summary in the imperative mood, e.g. `Add section on scalability`.

## Testing

Minimal unit tests live under `tests/`.
Run them with `pytest` or `python -m unittest` whenever you change code in `src/`.
Pure documentation edits can skip them.
