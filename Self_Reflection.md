# Self Reflection

This document summarises how Codex works and how it is used in this repository.

Codex runs inside an isolated cloud container with your repository preloaded. It can read and modify files, run tests, and commit changes. Each task is executed separately, and Codex provides citations for terminal logs and file references so you can verify every step.

Use AGENTS.md to give Codex instructions about preferred workflows and testing commands. For this repository, there are no automated tests yet, so focus on documentation updates and clarity.
